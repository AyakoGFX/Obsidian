## Types of Marketing Environment

### Micro Environment

The micro environment consists of factors that are closely related to the organisation and have a direct impact on its marketing activities. These factors are partially controllable.

**Company:**  
The internal environment of the company includes its departments such as finance, production, marketing, and human resources. All departments must work together to achieve marketing objectives.

**Suppliers:**  
Suppliers provide raw materials, components, and services to the organisation. Any delay or shortage from suppliers can affect production and customer satisfaction.

**Marketing Intermediaries:**  
Marketing intermediaries such as wholesalers, retailers, agents, and transport agencies help in the distribution of goods. Efficient intermediaries help companies reach customers easily.

**Customers:**  
Customers are the most important part of the micro environment. The organisation must understand customer needs, preferences, and expectations to satisfy them effectively.

**Competitors:**  
Competitors offer similar products in the market. A firm must analyze competitor strategies to maintain its market position.

### Macro Environment

The macro environment consists of external forces that are beyond the control of the organisation but significantly influence marketing decisions.

**Demographic Factors:**  
Demographic factors include population size, age structure, gender, education, and income. These factors affect the demand for goods and services.

**Economic Factors:**  
Economic conditions such as income levels, inflation, interest rates, and purchasing power influence consumer spending behaviour.

**Technological Factors:**  
Technological advancements lead to innovation and new product development. Companies must adapt to new technologies to remain competitive.

**Political and Legal Factors:**  
Government policies, laws, and regulations affect business operations. Companies must comply with legal requirements to avoid penalties.

**Cultural Factors:**  
Cultural values, beliefs, traditions, and customs influence consumer preferences and buying habits.

## Principles of Marketing (B.Com)

## Market Segmentation, Targeting and Positioning

---

## Introduction

In today’s competitive market, it is not possible for a company to satisfy all consumers with a single product. Consumers differ in needs, preferences, and buying behaviour. Therefore, marketers divide the market into segments, select suitable target markets, and position their products effectively. These strategies help organisations achieve better results with limited resources.

---

## Market Segmentation

Market segmentation is the process of dividing a large and heterogeneous market into smaller and homogeneous groups of consumers with similar needs and characteristics. Segmentation helps marketers understand customer requirements more clearly.

---

## Bases of Market Segmentation

### Geographic Segmentation

Geographic segmentation divides the market based on location such as region, climate, and area. Companies modify their products according to local needs and preferences.

### Demographic Segmentation

Demographic segmentation is based on variables such as age, gender, income, education, and occupation. It is widely used because demographic data is easy to collect and measure.

### Psychographic Segmentation

Psychographic segmentation considers lifestyle, personality, and values of consumers. It helps marketers understand consumer attitudes and interests.

### Behavioural Segmentation

Behavioural segmentation is based on consumer behaviour such as usage rate, brand loyalty, and benefits sought. It helps firms focus on highly profitable customers.

---

## Target Marketing

Target marketing involves evaluating different market segments and selecting one or more segments to serve. Companies concentrate their marketing efforts on chosen segments to maximize efficiency.

---

## Types of Targeting Strategies

### Undifferentiated Marketing

In this strategy, the firm offers one product to the entire market without differentiation.

### Differentiated Marketing

The firm targets several segments and designs different products for each segment.

### Concentrated Marketing

The firm focuses on a single market segment and specializes in meeting its needs.

---

## Positioning

Positioning refers to creating a unique image of a product in the minds of consumers compared to competitors. Effective positioning helps consumers easily identify and remember the product.

---

## Positioning Strategies

Companies use various strategies such as price-based, quality-based, benefit-based, and use-based positioning to differentiate their products.

**Example:**  
Apple positions its products as premium, innovative, and high-quality in the minds of consumers.

---

## Conclusion

Market segmentation, targeting, and positioning are essential marketing strategies. They help organisations focus on the right customers, use resources efficiently, and gain a competitive advantage in the market.
