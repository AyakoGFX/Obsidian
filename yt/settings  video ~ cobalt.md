if preferred video quality isn't available, next best is picked instead.

h264: best compatibility, average quality. max quality is 1080p. av1: best quality and efficiency. supports 8k & HDR. vp9: same quality as av1, but file is ~2x bigger. supports 4k & HDR. av1 and vp9 aren't widely supported, you might have to use additional software to play/edit them. cobalt picks next best codec if preferred one isn't available.

when "auto" is selected, cobalt will pick the best container automatically depending on selected codec: mp4 for h264; webm for vp9/av1.

allows downloading videos from platforms like tiktok and xiaohongshu in higher quality at cost of compatibility.

GIF conversion is inefficient, converted file may be obnoxiously big and low quality.
